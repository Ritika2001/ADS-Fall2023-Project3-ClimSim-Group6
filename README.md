+ Project summary: In this project, we replicated the quickstart notebook from the ClimSim to a Google Colab notebook for a simpler access to the ClimSim data. With this data loader, we utilized the Huggingface Hub to assist in reading the data files and loading it onto the Colab notebook. We also added visualizations extending what is within the ClimSim files to provide users more visual representations of the ClimSim data.
